    Takes a dictionary of coordinates. The dictionary keys are a 2-tuple
    containing (alpha, beta) angles at which each pupil image has been
    measured and the dictionary values are a 3-tuple containing
    (xcentroid, ycentroid, quality) for each measurement.

    alpha and beta are measured in degrees and xcentroid, ycentroid
    are measured in millimetres.
    
    pars is a data structure containing configurable parameters, such as
    pars.CURVATURE: the radius of curvature of the pupil wavefront.
    See the PUP_ALGN_EVALUATION_PARS data structure in vfr/conf.py.

    The returned values are pupil alignment errors in millimeter:
    TODO: Convert the units from mm on the screen to arcmin of pupil error?

    Any error should be signalled by throwing an Exception of class
    PupilAlignmentAnalysisError, with a string member which describes the problem.
