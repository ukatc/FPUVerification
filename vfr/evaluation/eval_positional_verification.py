    are the i,j,k indices of the positional repeteability measurement.
    Equal i and k mean equal step counts, and j indicates
    the arm and movement direction of the corresponding arm
    during measurement.

    The values of the dictionary are a 4-tuple
    (alpha_steps, beta_steps, x_measured_1, y_measured_1, x_measured_2, y_measured_2).

    Here, (alpha_steps, beta_steps) are the angle coordinates given by
    the motor step counts (measured in degrees), and (alpha_measured,
    beta_measured) are the cartesian values of the large (index 1) and
    the small (index 2) target measured from the images taken.


    The units are in dimensionless counts (for alpha_steps and beta_steps)
    and millimeter (for x_measured and y_measured).

    The returned value is the repeatability value in millimeter.

    Any error should be signalled by throwing an Exception of class
    ImageAnalysisError, with a string member which describes the problem.
