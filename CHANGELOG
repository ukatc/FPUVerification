	CHANGELOG

	Version 1.1.0 / 2019-09-17
	==========================

	* added improved Otsu image detection with separate parameters for small and large blobs

	Version 1.0.5 / 2019-08-09
	==========================

	* fixed two bugs in the positional verification evaluation which, incorrectly,
	resulted in too large errors
	* add versioning of positional verification evaluation algorithms
	* compute and store mean error vector of positional verification
	* add new plot for positional verification results, which can be select
	with "plot -sel=R" option.

	Version 1.0.4 / 2019-08-01
	==========================

	* The coordinate value of the "fixed" arm in
	the positional repeatability measurement is now
	adjusted so that it is within the range of
	measurement when it is the variable parameter.

	* For the high-resolution measurement, the number of positional
	repeatability arm angles is now configured as an integer multiple
	of the low-resolution number of measurements.

	* Added gearbox calibration function which fits data
	from positional repeatability test and stores
	a calibration table.

	* Include fitting to elliptical distortion of
	the positional repeatability images.

	* Calibration results are reported in the
	report section for positional repeatability.

	* The positional verification measurement checks
	now that the major version number of the
	calibration data matches the current version.

	* Changed algorithm and analysis version numbering to
	use semantic versioning of the form "major.minor.patch".
	Old floating point version numbers are upgraded automatically
	when retrieved from the database.

	* Organised and streamlined options to plot
	result data from datum repeatability, positional
	repeatability, and calibration. Plot options
	are documented in the general help and can
	also be viewed with the '--help-plot-selection'
	(alias '-hps') command line option.

	* Return error estimates for calibration in
	report output.

	* Automatically estimate camera rotation offset.

	Version 1.0.3 / 2019-07-08
	==========================

	* fix bug in reporting of large target metrology height result,
	which was erroneously reporting the result for the small target

	* detect incomplete LMDB reports (caused by too large data sets),
	and report them as a non-fatal error. This allows to use the "all"
	symbol to report results for all serial numbers

	Version 1.0.2 / 2019-07-02
	==========================

	* Move FPU to position (-179,0) after checking alpha_limit_min,
	to allow for higher tolerances in datum switch

	Version 1.0.1 / 2019-06-27
	==========================

	* correct fix in parsion of CAN id

	Version 1.0.0 / 2019-06-14
	==========================

	* allow to use CAN IDs instead of logical fpu_ids in
	measurement configuration

	* improvements in gearbox calibration evaluation; still not completely
	working

	Version 0.9.3 / 2019-06-18
	==========================

	* allow to select set of serial numbers by -sn="~${REGEX}"
	where ${REGEX} is a regular expression such as "C.*".

	Version 0.9.2 / 2019-06-11
	==========================

	* increase default acceleration limits

	Version 0.9.0 / 2019-06-11
	==========================

	* add tolerance parameter to Otsu blob detection algorithm

	* colorize "OK"/"FAILED" result in report

	* many improvements and bug fixes

	Version 0.8.7 / 2019-06-05
	==========================

	* Replace RSS error measure with percentile values of magnitude
	of error vectors in the image plane

	Version 0.8.6 / 2019-05-30
	==========================

	* add plot subcommand which allows to inspect repeatability errors

	* update to report format for gearbox fitting

	* fix reporting for limit detection

	Version 0.8.5 / 2019-05-27
	==========================

	* correct and complete task sets

	* tolerate a configurable fraction of image analysis errors

	Version 0.8.4 / 2019-05-23
	==========================

	* add distortion correction function

	Version 0.8.4 / 2019-05-13
	==========================

	* fix passing of custom waveform parameters
	* fix bug in datum repeatability computation

	Version 0.8.2 / 2019-05-02
	==========================

	* added: mail handler for reporting fatal errors

	Version 0.8.1 / 2019-05-03
	==========================

	* improve logging

	Version 0.8.0 / 2019-05-01
	==========================

	* added extensive logging

	Version 0.7.0 / 2019-04-29
	==========================

	* by default, omit measurements which require a fibre in the FPU

	Version 0.6.0 / 2019-04-25
	==========================

	* allow to orderly stop program using SIGQUIT / "<Ctrl><\>" keys

	* it is now possible to run the program from another
	directory than the source directory

	Version 0.4.0 / 2019-04-03 - first tested version
	=================================================
