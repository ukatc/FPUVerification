	CHANGELOG

	Version 1.0.4 / 2019-08-01
	==========================

	* The coordinate value of the "fixed" arm in
	the positional repeatability measurement is now
	adjusted so that it is within the range of
	measurement when it is the variable parameter.

	* For the high-resolution measurement, the number of positional
	repeatability arm angles is now configured as a multiple of the
	low-resolution number of measurements.

	* Added gearbox calibration function which fits data
	from positional repeatability test and stores
	a calibration table.

	* Include fitting to elliptical distortion of
	the positional repeatability images.

	* Calibration results are reported in the
	report section for positional repeatability.

	* The positional verification measurement checks
	now that the major version number of the
	calibration data matches the current version.

	* Changed algorithm and analysis version numbering to
	use semantic versioning of the form "major.minor.patch".
	Old floating point version numbers are upgraded
	when retrieved from the database.

	* Organised and streamlined options to plot
	result data from datum repeatability, positional
	repeatability, and calibration. Plot options
	are documented in the general help and can
	also be viewed with the '--help-plot-selection'
	(alias '-hps') command line option.

	* Return error estimates for calibration in
	report output.

	* Automatically estimate camera rotation offset.

	Version 0.4.1
	=============
	* it is now possible to run the program from another
	directory than the source directory

	Version 0.4.0 / 2019-04-03 - first tested version
	=================================================
