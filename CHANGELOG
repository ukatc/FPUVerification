	CHANGELOG

	Version 1.0.3
	=============

	* fix bug in reporting of large target metrology height result,
	which was erroneously reporting the result for the small target

	* detect incomplete LMDB reports (caused by too large data sets),
	and report them as a non-fatal error. This allows to use the "all"
	symbol to report results for all serial numbers

	Version 1.0.2
	=============

	* Move FPU to position (-179,0) after checking alpha_limit_min,
	to allow for higher tolerances in datum switch

	Version 1.0.1
	=============

	* correct fix in parsion of CAN id

	Version 1.0.0
	=============

	* allow to use CAN IDs instead of logical fpu_ids in
	measurement configuration

	* improvements in gearbox calibration evaluation; still not completely
	working

	Version 0.9.3
	=============

	* allow to select set of serial numbers by -sn="~${REGEX}"
	where ${REGEX} is a regular expression such as "C.*".

	Version 0.9.2
	=============
	* increase default acceleration limits

	Version 0.9.0
	=============
	* add tolerance parameter to Otsu blob detection algorithm

	* colorize "OK"/"FAILED" result in report

	* many improvements and bug fixes

	Version 0.8.7
	=============

	* Replace RSS error measure with percentile values of magnitude
	of error vectors in the image plane

	Version 0.8.6
	=============

	* add plot subcommand which allows to inspect repeatability errors

	* update to report format for gearbox fitting

	* fix reporting for limit detection

	Version 0.8.5
	=============

	* correct and complete task sets

	* tolerate a configurable fraction of image analysis errors

	Version 0.8.4
	=============

	* add distortion correction function

	Version 0.8.4
	=============

	* fix passing of custom waveform parameters
	* fix bug in datum repeatability computation

	Version 0.8.2
	=============

	* added: mail handler for reporting fatal errors

	Version 0.8.1
	=============

	* improve logging

	Version 0.8.0
	=============

	* added extensive logging

	Version 0.7.0
	=============

	* by default, omit measurements which require a fibre in the FPU

	Version 0.6.0
	=============

	* allow to orderly stop program using SIGQUIT / "<Ctrl><\>" keys

	Version 0.4.1
	=============
	* it is now possible to run the program from another
	directory than the source diractory

	Version 0.4.0 / 2019-04-03 - first tested version
