Prototype script to get images from Basler GIGe cameras

This is a prototype script and as such has several this still need to done, see 
below.

Prerequisites
-------------

Pylon software - PyPylon is just python bindings to the C++ pylon software, the 
pylon software should be reinstalled.

:TODO:
1[SIMPLE] Move config objects to files that can be read -[UPDATE 27/09/2018] Config 
objects are less useful current use case is separate initialisation, exposure time 
and image acquisition steps.

2[COMPLEX] Determine the best grab strategy (see samples/grabstrategies.py , while 
developing my strategy is to do the least configuration possible.

3 [SIMPLE] Throw pretty exception when file already exists, need to manually check 
imsave clobbers. [UPDATE] According to SW this is acceptable behaviour. Calling code 
does not have a default save location.

:DONE:
4 [Complex] Add support for changing the exposure time.

:History:
31/08/2018: Creation AOB
03/09/2018: Fixed countOfImagesToGrab variable not existing. Version delivered as 
            prototype 0.1
20/09/2018: 0.2.0 Updated to include exposure time parameter
27/09/2018: 0.3.0 Refactoring to an OOP design
01/10/2018: 0.3.1 Fixed Error and added support to find a camera.
03/10/2018: 0.3.2 Fixed indent issues and updated documentation.
27/10/2020: Added saveBurst method. (SMB)
08/12/2020: Add leading zeroes to file suffixes so the files can be sorted
            more easily (SMB).
