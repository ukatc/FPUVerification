Test image filename convention is FpuID_CameraID_testN_imageN.bmp .

The results I get currently are as follows:

Hope this is OK!  I think the results above show that sensitivity to
small changes in illumination is within the accuracy requirements.
The exception that is returned on metcal_002 is because the
illumination for that station is proving difficult.  The ambient LED
is not bright enough, so I had the door ajar and the silhouette light
on to get enough flux onto the targets.  Unfortunately, this causes
very non-uniform illumination, so the longer exposure must have caused
some adjacent reflections to overly contaminate the image.  We'll fix
this soon.
