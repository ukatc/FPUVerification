INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR VERIFICATION SOFTWARE
---------------------------------------------------

This recipe describes a complete new install
of the verification software. 

PREREQUISITES
=============


1) A 64-bit Linux system with kernel 2.6 or newer.  (Debian >= 9,
   Ubuntu >= 17.10, Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS, Scientific Linux >= 2017,
   Arch Linux are all supported). 


2) To retrieve packages, both git and python-pip are needed:

   sudo apt-get install git-core
   sudo apt-get install python-pip

3) The EtherCAN FPU driver and python interface

   * fpu_driver

   git clone jnix@dalriada/MOONS/fpu_driver
   cd fpu_driver
   git checkout can1

4) The FPU Verification software

   * FPUVerification verification software bundled with hardware interfaces
   
   git clone jnix@dalriada/MOONS/FPUVerification
   


4) for the C++ driver and static library

 * gcc-4.9 (essentially, with support for C++11)
 * Linux-2.6 or newer (requiring support for eventfd)
 * glibc-2.3.2 (epoll support)
 * liblmdb0 (Lightning Memory database, aka LMDB)
 * lmdb-utils (contains backup utility for LMDB)

5) for the test code and Python bindings

 * Python-2.7
 * boost-1-66 , which can be downloaded from http://www.boost.org/users/download/
 * python-lmdb (Python bindings)
 * pip install lmdb
 * apt install lmdb-utils

6) For the library which accesses the FTDI driver which controls the Thorlabs stages:

 * libftdi-dev
 * libftdi1

  In source code available from https://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/download.php .
  Is already contained in Ubuntu and Debian:

  apt install libftdi-dev libftd1


7) for accessing the lamp DAQ controller

 This requires libuldaq.

 Source code: https://github.com/mccdaq/uldaq

 This needs to be build and installed as in the instructions.

 * libuldaq

 # furthermore, a matching python module is needed
 * pip install uldaq
 

8) for the basler pylon software (can be used to view the cameras manually)

 * pylon-5.0.0

INSTALLATION
============

-- The following needs to be done as the system user,
because it changes system-wide configuration.  --


SYSTEM SETUP
------------

sudo apt-get install python-dev python-scipy python-numpy
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-lmdb python-pip python-enum34 python-imageio
sudo apt-get install python-opencv python-pil:amd64 python-pygments python-subprocess32

sudo apt-get install libusb-dev libusb-1.0.0-dev liblmdb0 
sudo apt-get install git git-gui gitg gitk git-man

# for running path planning algorithms written in racket, one needs the
# racket compiler and run-time environment:

sudo apt-get install racket 


INSTALLING BOOST LIBRARIES
--------------------------

Recent Boost libraries are required to build the Python module, which
is needed in the verification system (but not in the final ICS
software).

Please keep in mind that any installed different version of boost
libraries is very likely an essential part of your Linux system, so do
NOT uninstall older versions from your system!

* Do the configuration/build from a normal user account,
  and change to the root account for the install.
  This should have the result that the library is
  installed system-wide under /usr/local, where it
  will be found.

* for security, verify boost package signature using gnupg

* unpack boost package:

$ tar xzf boost_1_66_0.tar.gz

* build package:

$ cd boost_1_66_0/
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./b2

* install package into /usr/local directory:

$ sudo ./b2 install

To make the boost libraries accessible when the
final program is run, you need to add the
two commands

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

to /etc/profile . 

Also, you should add the directory with the boost header files (by
default /usr/local/include) to the path configured in the environment
variable CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:

CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include

Logging out and logging in again activates these changes.



INSTALLING UDEV RULES
----------------------

This is needed so that the Thorlabs interface
gets permission to access the USB devices.

sudo cp FPUVerification/config/99-libftdi.rules /etc/udev/config.d
sudo udevadm trigger

NETWORKING
==========

Cameras and EtherCAN gateways should be connected
to an internal network interface. You need
to configure this interface with IP number and netmask
like this:

vfrig@moons-pc01:/home/moonsadmin$ ip route
169.254.0.0/16 dev enp4s0 proto kernel scope link src 169.254.0.0 metric 101
192.168.0.0/24 via 192.168.0.2 dev enp4s0 proto static metric 30
192.168.0.0/24 dev enp4s0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.0.2 metric 101
195.194.120.0/22 dev enp0s31f6 proto kernel scope link src 195.194.120.169 metric 100

In Ubuntu, this can be done via the "wired internet connection"
widget near the login and audio settings button.
If in doubt, ask an expert.


USER ADMINISTRATION AND SYSTEMWIDE FILES
========================================


As root user, create a user group moons.
Assign this group to all users which are
going to run the verification software,
or the FPU driver.


create the folders:

/moonsdata/verification
/moonsdata/fpudb

Assign these directories to belong to the group moons:

chgrp moons -R /moonsdata/verification
chgrp moons -R /moonsdata/fpudb

Either, mount the file system /moonsdata with the
mount option bsdgroups, or set the "set group id" flag:

chmod g+s /moonsdata/verification
chmod g+s /moonsdata/fpudb




BUILDING THE DRIVER AND PYTHON MODULE
------------------------------------

-- ONLY the following commands and installations should be done
as a normal user --


cd $HOME/fpu_driver

Run

# make wrapper

This builds the binary extension module fpu_driver.so
and places it into the subdirectory /python.
In the same subdirectory, there are some test
scripts which can be used to test the module.

The paths with the driver library
need to be added to $HOME/.profile like this:

export PATH=$PATH:${HOME}/FPUVerification:${HOME}/FPUVerification/bin
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:${HOME}/fpu_driver/python:${HOME}/FPUVerification/:${HOME}/FPUVerification/camera-calibration



INSTALLING PIP REQUIREMENTS FOR VERIFICATION SOFTWARE
-----------------------------------------------------

pip install -r FPUVerification/requirements.txt
